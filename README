The intention of the SymbolMath project is to produce a Java library for symbolic math.
Expression simplification and equation solving are just two examples of possible applications.

At the moment the source contains:

    1. A simplistic (but working) scanner
    2. A parser that understands the four basic operations and the power operation
    3. A strongly typed AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) representing the parsed expression
    3. A transformer that converts binary operators into n-ary operators and extracts
       constant multipliers (this makes simplification easier)
    4. A simplifier that does not do anything yet!
